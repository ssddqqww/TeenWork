# TeenWork
A Telegram bot that helps teens find simple tasks, complete them, and earn rewards. Built with Python and Aiogram.

# Telegram Bot Project

This repository contains the code for our Telegram bot.

## Project Goal
The bot helps to complete tasks and automates interaction with users.

## Repository Structure
- main.py – the main bot file, where the program starts
- .gitignore – a list of files that should not be added to Git
- LICENSE – project license (MIT)
- README.md – project description (this file)
- analytics.md – team notes and analytics: who did what, current tasks, issues

## How to Work
- To edit text (analytics), use analytics.md directly on GitHub
- For code, commit changes to the appropriate files (main.py and others) locally or via pull request
